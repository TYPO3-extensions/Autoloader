What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension implements a framework for autoload mechanisms for 3rd party extension. There are different loader for different extension targets. The aim of the extension is a smart :index:`"Convention over configuration"` pattern to reduce the amount of configurations in e.g. ext_tables, ext_localconf. To get more details for each loader, please read the technical general section first. After the general integration you are ready to learn something about the loaders.
